# Builds are signed if the settingsSigningEnabled property is set to true.
# To enable signing, it is recommended to leave this file untouched and to
# create a gradle.properties in your <USER_HOME>/.gradle/ directory and override
# the setting there.  It is also necessary to set the following properties:
# * signing.keyId - Something like ABCDEFGH (see gpg --list-keys)
# * signing.secretKeyRingFile - Something like /home/<username>/.gnupg/secring.gpg
# * signing.password - The password to unlock the secret key.
